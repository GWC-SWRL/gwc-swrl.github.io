    <h> Thank You Note </h>
    <p class="blue-text"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While here in Girls Who Code, I have learned how to code--or at least the basics. I thought I would struggle a lot in GWC since I have never learned how to do any kind of coding at all, but it was actually easy to learn! I am very grateful I joined GWC, and it's all thanks to Ms. Lynn. She has done so much for the Girls Who Code club, it's crazy!</p>
